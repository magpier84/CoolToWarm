# CoolToWarm

The task is to implement the conversion from RGB to oRGB color space as defined in this paper - http://graphics.stanford.edu/~boulos/papers/orgb_sig.pdf. So, you need to convert an image from RGB color space into oRGB color space and then apply “warm to cool” adjustment, as it is shown in the figure 14 of “oRGB: A Practical Opponent Color Space for Computer Graphics” paper, convert it back to RGB, and save it out or display it.
